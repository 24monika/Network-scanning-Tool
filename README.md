Requirements
1. Python Version: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Panos Library: Install the `pan-os-python` library.  
   ```bash
   pip install pan-os-python
   ```
3. Firewall Access:
   - The script connects to a firewall using its management IP address and API key.
   - Ensure API access is enabled and that you have the required permissions to read and delete objects.
Code Explanation
1. Importing the Required Library
```python
from panos.firewall import Firewall
```
The `panos.firewall` module provides a way to interact with a Palo Alto Networks firewall.

2. Connecting to the Firewall
```python
fw = Firewall("10.0.0.1", api_key="your_api_key")
```
Replace `"10.0.0.1"` with your firewall's management IP address and `"your_api_key"` with your actual API key.

3. Identifying Unused Objects
Unused Service Objects
```python
unused_services = fw.services.unused()
```
This retrieves a list of unused service objects from the firewall.

Unused Address Objects
```python
unused_addresses = fw.addresses.unused()
```
This retrieves a list of unused address objects from the firewall.

4. Outputting Unused Objects
```python
if unused_services:
    print("Unused service objects found:")
    for unused_service in unused_services:
        print(unused_service)
```
The script lists unused service objects, if any.

```python
if unused_addresses:
    print("Unused address objects found:")
    for unused_address in unused_addresses:
        print(unused_address)
```
Similarly, unused address objects are listed.

5. Deleting Unused Objects
Service Objects
```python
for unused_service in unused_services:
    fw.services.delete(unused_service)
```
Each unused service object is deleted from the firewall.

Address Objects
```python
for unused_address in unused_addresses:
    fw.addresses.delete(unused_address)
```
Each unused address object is deleted from the firewall.

How to Use
1. Setup the Script:
   - Replace `10.0.0.1` with your firewallâ€™s IP.
   - Replace `your_api_key` with your API key.
2. Run the Script:
   Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Verify Changes:
   Check your firewall configuration to confirm the unused objects have been removed.

Limitations
- **Permissions:** The API key must have sufficient permissions to read and delete objects.
- **Error Handling:** The script assumes all operations succeed. Add error handling for robustness.

Future Enhancements
- Include logging to track changes.
- Add a dry-run mode to preview deletions.
- Enhance error handling for failed operations.
